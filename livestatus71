   15:01 Local Time, 14:01 GMT, 19:31 IST: Virat Kohli looks content on the
   balcony. His boys have put on a stellar show today. India were forced to
   bat first on a green-looking surface at Cardiff. There was some lateral
   movement on offer and Shikhar succumbed to that. Rohit followed his
   partner into the dressing room too. Virat looked good for a brief period
   but the star of the show was KL Rahul. He struck a magnificent hundred and
   did whatever the team management would have asked from him. With this
   knock, he has sealed the number-four spot for India's first match against
   South Africa. His challenger for that spot, Vijay Shankar was dismissed
   for two. So, that makes things clearer.

   49.6

   Shakib to Jadeja, 1 run, flighted one, Jadeja slog sweeps it straight to
   deep mid-wicket. And that concludes India's innings!

   49.5

   Shakib to Jadeja, FOUR, six followed by a boundary! Exactly what India
   were looking for. It was on a fuller length and was on the stumps, Jadeja
   goes down on his knees and sweeps. It comes off the inside half of the
   blade and races to fine leg fence

   49.4

   Shakib to Jadeja, SIX, Jadeja joins the party too. They are all at it. He
   stays put in the crease, reaches for it and tonks it over long-on for a
   maximum

   49.3

   Shakib to Jadeja, no run, fuller and wide of off, it keeps a shade low and
   Jadeja could only push it back

   Ravindra Jadeja, left handed bat, comes to the crease

   49.2

   Shakib to Dhoni, out Bowled!! Shakib gets the reward for being audacious.
   And that ends a fantastic innings from MS dhoni. Shakib provides a lot of
   flight on this delivery, Dhoni comes down the track to smoke it over deep
   mid-wicket. It came much slower than MS anticipated, he heaves at it in a
   wild fashion. It goes through his defence and clatters his stumps. Dhoni b
   Shakib 113(78) [4s-8 6s-7]

   Shakib to Dhoni, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!

   49.1

   Shakib to Dhoni, no run, flighted and wide of of, Dhoni dashes down,
   heaves at it but misses it. It hits him on the pads and pops upto short
   fine

   48.6

   Abu Jayed to Dhoni, 1 run, low full-toss on the stumps, Dhoni drives it
   straight down the ground
